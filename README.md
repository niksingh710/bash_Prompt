# Requirements

Git needed to be installed and this is tested on Linux with bash shell.

## Ubuntu/Debian based distro

### (Or Distros have apt package manager)

`sudo apt install git`

Other Distro USERS use google 😅.

## Note

The fonts in 'assets/fonts' directory is required to make it work.

## Tip

Try different branches to check new edits.

How to ?

Navigating to directory.

`cd ~/.bash_customPrompt/`

Seeing available branches

`git branch`

To try a branch

`git checkout <branchName> && exec bash`
